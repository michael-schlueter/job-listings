# Job Listings
> This project is a challenge from [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The challenge was to build a landing page displaying job opportunities with the ability to filter them based on different categories.



## General Information
- I undertook this project in order to familiarize myself more with using React in combination with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Another point of emphasis of this project was to build an optimal layout for the site depending on the screensize of the user's device
- The basic content was provided via a JSON file as well as some design specs in a style-guide
- I followed parts of [this tutorial](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZQ8m08cbF0/) from [Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA/) for the general Tailwind setup of the project and implementing the filtering feature. 



## Technologies Used
- React 17.0.2
- TypeScript 4.5.4
- TailwindCSS 3.0.7



## Features
- Displaying jobs filtered for several categories selected by the user
- Adding / Deleting filters
